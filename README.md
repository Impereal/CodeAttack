## TSA Skill Development Round B Challenge - Software Development
### By Mukund R and Leean Z
This project is part of a TSA competition in which we were tasked with the creation of software for Skill Development Round B. In this project, we are creating an educational game which teaches the fundamentals of programming via code blocks. This program will encourage children from ages 5-12 through a variety of programming tasks and quests that are incorporated into the roleplay of a character within the game. Children will be able to use the knowledge they acquire from playing the game to program effectively and solve problems logically throughout their daily life.

#### Software Requirements:
The minimum software requirements to run this program are Windows 8.1 with x64 architecture or the macOS 10.9 as well as 4 GB of RAM or 5 GB free disk space. Additionally, these python packages are required for the execution of this program:

* PIL (Pillow) 8.0.1
* Pygame 2.0.1
